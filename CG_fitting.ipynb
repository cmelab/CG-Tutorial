    "# Coarse graining with CG_Compound class \n",
    "Coarse-graining is a technique which provides a computational speed-up in molecular simulation by abstracting away some atomistic detail and thus reducing the degrees of freedom. One example of a coarse-grain model is the united atom model in which hydrogen atoms are treated implicitly and lumped in with with their heavier neighbors. (e.g., a carbon bonded to three hydrogens, $CH_3$, would be treated as one bead; the bending and stretching degrees of freedom between $C-H$ would be lost.) More examples of coarse-grain models and their benefits can be found in our recent [perspective paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109129). \n",
