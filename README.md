# Coarse-graining tutorial
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cmelab/CG-Tutorial/master)

This tutorial demonstrates code which ties together [mbuild](https://mosdef.org/mbuild/index.html) and [openbabel](http://openbabel.org/docs/current/)'s [SMILES/SMARTS](https://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/index.html) matching to help create coarse-grain chemical structures. 
The tutorial also demonstrates how to initialize these coarse-grain structures in a [HOOMD](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) simulation using [foyer](https://mosdef.org/foyer/) and analyze the the output of the simulation using [freud](https://freud.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

To read more about how using simple models and community-driven, open-source tools can help lower cognitive load, increase simulation transferability, repoducibility, usability, and extensibility ([TRUE](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8966312)), and make the world a better place, please read our [perspective paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.commatsci.2019.109129).

This tutorial depends heavily on tools from [MoSDeF](https://mosdef.org/) and the [Glotzer group](https://github.com/glotzerlab).
